# Jupyter notebook

This notebook is a simple jupyter notebook. It only has markdown and code cells. And it does not contain consecutive markdown cells. We start with an addition:

```python
a = 1
b = 2
a + b
```
```
3
```
Now we return a few tuples

```python
a, b
```
```
(1, 2)
```

```python
a, b, a+b
```
```
(1, 2, 3)
```
And this is already the end of the notebook
